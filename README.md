# Musig playground
A playground for creating and redeeming musig outputs

Right now this app is extremely basic. It just does a single musig transaction in your browser console and leaves the actual screen blank. Open up your browser console (ctrl+shift+i, then click console) to see the magic. Eventually I want to make options so you can construct a custom musig spend on testnet.
